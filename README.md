# belly-button-challenge
Unit 14 challenge assignment


This repository is to create a dashboard to display data that was collected to catalog the microbes that colonize human navels.

A dropdown selector list was added to the dashboard to allow anyone to change to observe and look at different subject's data.

The dashboard includes a bar graph with the top 10 microbes for the selected subject.  There is also a data card that displays basic demographic data about the subject.  Then there is a bubble graph that displays all microbe data of a given subject.  All three of those change as the chosen subject selection changes.
